We finally got the HIEE award data back from DHCD. See the email below and attached. Wanted to share with both of you. 
Let me know if you all have any questions about the data.

Hi Isabel, 

Attached is the project award data for HIEE. I structured it the same as the VHTF award data. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Best, 
Elizabeth

Hi Chloe, 

Apologies, I think I got confused as well! I apologize if I dropped the ball in clarifying our request with you. I spoke to Elizabeth on the phone after the VAGHC, but I cannot remember if there was a required next step. I don't think you were included on all of our emails, so the confusion could be a result of that error on my part. 

We just need the funded totals for HIEE on a project by project basis. We do not need information on the other ASNH programs at this time - just HIEE. 
In the original spreadsheet Elizabeth provided us on October 29 (I attached it here just for reference), we got all the application data by project for all of ASNH, but only the actual funded award totals for VHTF. We would just like the same funded award totals for HIEE. 
In other words, we would love the same info provided in the second tab "Funded projects - VHTF" but for HIEE. We do NOT need it for the other ASNH programs like HTF, HOME, etc. I hope that helps reduce the time or workload to provide this information. 

We know we cannot assume that what people applied for under HIEE was what they actually received, so we just want to know the final result of their application - who actually got HIEE and how much - over the past several years since the program began. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions. Hopefully this is straightforward and not overly time consuming. 
Thank you again!
Best,

    Hi Isabel,

    This one is on me! I misunderstood and thought you and Elizabeth had connected on this below. Just let us know the details of how you need this formatted and we can get it out to you.

    Are you looking for this information on a project-by-project basis? eg: Sample Apartments - Better Housing Coalition, Richmond - $1M VHTF, $1M HOME, $2M HIEE

    Is there any other information you're looking for?

    Hello Elizabeth, 

    Hope you are doing well and enjoyed your weekend. I just wanted to check in to see if there was any update about getting the HIEE data we requested. I know it takes some time to get everything approved, but do you have any updates on the timeline? 

    Again, I appreciate your help on this. 

    Take care,

        Hi Chloe,

        I spoke to Elizabeth on the phone earlier this week. We talked about our questions and I think all we need for now is just the HIEE award funded data (by project). We don’t need the HOME and NHT data for now. 

        I hope that isn’t a heavy lift!
        Thank you and have a great weekend,

            Elizabeth, 

            Hope you are doing well today. I had a chance to check in with Jonathan about the data. Another question came up that would probably be answered if we were able to see funding for other ASNH programs too. Would you be able to share the funding decisions for HIEE and the other ASNH programs to compare with the HTF data? I hope that this is not a heavy lift - please let us know. I am guessing that it is easier to leave extra data in than it is to take it out - so you do not need to refine this down or include any application data. Just the funded totals, if possible. 

            Thank you so much! Please let me know if this is an issue. We can touch base about it at the VAGHC next week too, if needed. 
            Take care,

                Hello Elizabeth, 

                Happy Halloween!

                I have a follow up question about HIEE funding. In the "application data" tab, is the number that was requested in the application for HIEE the actual number that they ended up receiving if their application was approved? In other words, can we assume that the actual HIEE awards are indicated in the HIEE (As Requested) column? Or does the requested amount usually differ from the actual funded amount? If that is the case, would it be easy for you to share the most recent list of HIEE $ awards per project? 
                I hope that this is not a burdensome request. We are working on a report for HIEE as well, which is why I ask. 

                Thank you!

                    Good afternoon Elizabeth, 

                    Thank you so much for preparing this data and sharing it with us. We appreciate your time! We are looking forward to diving into this data and using it to compile our next Housing Trust Fund Impact Report. 
                    I will let you know if we have any questions or any follow up once we have had a chance to look through it. And we will share our report with you all when it is finished! 

                    Again, thank you!

                        Good morning, 

                        Attached is application and project data for rental VHTF projects since FY2017. Please note: 

                            Our team does not manage the VHTF homeownership data so the spreadsheet I sent only includes rental new construction/rehab applications and funded project data. We were not able to include TDC.
                            The dataset begins at FY2017 since that is when projects started requesting VHTF for the ASNH program. Prior to FY2017, projects may have received a VHTF as part of the Vibrant Communities Initiative (VCI) program. You will see one FY2015 VHTF project in the data which was a VCI award. 
                            We collect AMI data based on 30%, 60%, 80%, 120% and market rate data and do not have 50% AMI specific data available for VHTF

                        Please let me know if you have any questions and thank you also for your patience with getting this to you. 

                        Best,
