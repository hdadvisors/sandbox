## Setup

This document provides a step-by-step methodology to model three different Local Rent Supplement Program (LRSP) scenarios for the City of Alexandria. Data is created, transformed, and visualized using the R coding language. The R libraries used for this analysis are listed below.

## Standard parameters

### Income limits

The models use HUD's FY 2023 Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSP) Income Limits for Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD HUD Metro FMR Area.[^1] These are the official income limits used to determine eligibility for LIHTC projects and other affordable multifamily properties financed by tax-exempt bonds.

While the MTSP limits differ slightly from the standard income limits used for Housing Choice Vouchers, public housing, and other HUD-supported assistance programs, they are used here because they publish limits for a greater range of AMI levels, including 40% AMI and 60% AMI. The City of Alexandria generally uses MTSP limits for its housing programs.

### Fair Market Rents

Models where the rent subsidy is calculated based on Fair Market Rents (FMR) use the current Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMR) adopted by the Arlington Redevelopment and Housing Authority for 2023. SAFMRs are provided by ZIP code.

While actual subsidy amounts will depend on the ZIP code where the tenant lives, models will use the average values (by unit size) across all ZIP codes. This is a simplification to avoid making assumptions about the geographic distribution of participating households.

## Scenario A - Reduce Cost Burden for 30% to 50% AMI Households

This scenario outlines a LRSP with a total annual allocation of \$500,000. The primary goal of the program is to reduce housing cost burden among households with incomes between 30% and 50% AMI. The model uses the following inputs to estimate the number of households served.

+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Variable**                       | **Input**                                            |
+====================================+======================================================+
| *Total program budget*             | \$500,000\newline                                    |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| *Eligibility*                      | Household income between\newline                     |
|                                    | 30% and 50% AMI\newline                              |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| *Subsidy amount*                   | Difference between the affordable monthly\newline    |
|                                    | rent at 60% AMI and the affordable monthly\newline   |
|                                    | rent at 40% AMI\newline                              |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| *Distribution of unit sizes*\      | 25% - Studios\newline                                |
| *among participants*               | 25% - 1-bedroom\newline                              |
|                                    | 25% - 2-bedroom\newline                              |
|                                    | 25% - 3-bedroom\newline                              |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| *Distribution of incomes*\         | 25% - 30% AMI\newline                                |
| *among participants*               | 50% - 40% AMI\newline                                |
|                                    | 25% - 50% AMI\newline                                |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| *Administrative overhead*          | 15% of total program budget                          |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Notes:

* No other eligibility conditions apply.
* “Affordable monthly rent” is 30% of gross household income.
* The subsidy calculated for each household is respective to their household size.
* The administrative overhead includes housing-specific case management.

\newpage

### Inputs

Assign budget (dollars) and overhead costs (percent) variables:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Budget allocation
sA_budget <- 500000

# Overhead percentage
sA_overhead <- 0.15

```

Assign household distributions by AMI and unit size (number of bedrooms):

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of households by AMI
sA_ami <- c(`30% AMI` = 0.25, `40% AMI` = 0.50, `50% AMI` = 0.25)

# Distribution of households by unit size
sA_unit <- c(
  `bedroom0` = 0.25, `bedroom1` = 0.25,
  `bedroom2` = 0.25, `bedroom3` = 0.25
  )

```

Subsidy amounts are determined by household size, but the model assumptions only provide a distribution of unit sizes. Therefore, we need to make reasonable assumptions about the distribution of different household sizes among each unit size, as defined by number of bedrooms (`bedrooms`). This breakdown is shown in the code below:

* Studio: 100% 1-person
* 1-bedroom: 50% 1-person, 50% 2-person
* 2-bedroom: 30% 2-person, 40% 3-person, 30% 4-person
* 3-bedroom: 30% 3-person, 40% 4-person, 30% 5-person

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of household sizes by unit size
sA_person <- list(
    `bedroom0` = c(`person1` = 1),
    `bedroom1` = c(`person1` = 0.5, `person2` = 0.5),
    `bedroom2` = c(`person2` = 0.3, `person3` = 0.4, `person4` = 0.3),
    `bedroom3` = c(`person3` = 0.3, `person4` = 0.4, `person5` = 0.3)
  )

```

```{r}

sA_person |>
  enframe(name = "bedrooms", value = "persons") |> 
  unnest(persons) |> 
  mutate(person = names(persons)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = person, values_from = persons) |> 
  mutate(
    across(2:6, ~ as.character(.x)),
    across(2:6, ~ replace_na(.x, "-"))
    ) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "lccccc", linesep = "") |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position")

```

### Calculations

Calculate affordable rents at 40% AMI and 60% AMI for households with 1 to 5 persons (`hh_size`) to determine monthly subsidy amounts (`subsidy`): 

```{r}

### Scenario A results

*Average annual program cost per household: $8,928.57*

\
Under Scenario A, a total program budget of \$500,000 with a 15% administrative overhead leaves \$425,000 to fund rental assistance. Given the assumed household distributions by AMI, unit size, and household size, the total number of households served is 56. Over half of these would be persons living on their own, or with one other person.

## Scenario B - Stabilize Unhoused Persons

This scenario outlines a LRSP serving a total of 150 households experiencing housing insecurity. The primary goal of the program is to provide deep rental assistance to help these households achieve housing stability and avoid homelessness. The model uses the following inputs to estimate the annual program cost required to serve 150 households.

+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Variable**                       | **Input**                                            |

| *Administrative overhead*          | 20% of total program budget                          |
+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Notes:

* No other eligibility conditions apply.
* “Affordable monthly rent” is 30% of gross household income.
* The subsidy calculated for each household is respective to their household size.
* The administrative overhead is higher than Scenario A to accommodate more intensive case management requirements for persons experiencing homelessness.

\newpage

### Inputs

Assign households served and overhead costs (percent) variables:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Total households served
sB_hh_served <- 150

# Overhead percentage
sB_overhead <- 0.20

```

We can reasonably assume that all single-person households will live in studios, while all households with children will live in 2-bedroom units. Therefore, we do not need separate distribution shares for each. However, we do need to determine more specific household sizes.

For this model, among households with children, we will assume the following breakdown, as shown in the code below:

* 1/2 are 2-person (adult and child)
* 1/4 are 3-person (adult and two children, or two adults and child)
* 1/4 are 4-person (adult and three children, or two adults and two children)

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of households by size
sB_person <- c(
  `person1` = 0.667, # 2/3
  `person2` = 0.167, # 1/2 of 1/3
  `person3` = 0.083, # 1/4 of 1/3
  `person4` = 0.083  # 1/4 of 1/3
  )

```

Assign household distribution by income and calculate :

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of households by income
sB_income <- c(`ssi` = 0.5, `1500` = 0.5)

```

Because SSI amounts depend on whether the beneficiary lives alone or is married, their affordable rents will vary. However, due to the relatively small share of households in this model that could include two married adults, we will assume that any persons enrolled in SSI receive benefits for an individual. The current monthly SSI amount for an eligible individual is \$943.[^2]

[^2]: [SSI Federal Payment Amounts for 2024](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/SSI.html) (Accessed 2024-01-19)

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Monthly SSI income for eligible individual
sB_ssi <- 943

```

\newpage

### Calculations

Calculate affordable rents for SSI income and \$1,500/month (`income_source`) for households with 1 to 4 persons (`hh_size`) to determine monthly subsidy amounts (`subsidy`): 

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Monthly subsidy about by household size
sB_subsidy <- hud_ami |> 
  filter(
    AMI %in% c("60% AMI"),        # 60% AMI only
    str_detect(hh_size, "[1234]") # 1-4 person households only
    ) |> 
  mutate(
    aff_rent_60ami = income/12 * 0.3 # 30% of monthly income
  ) |> 
  select(2, 4) |> 
  mutate(
    `ssi` = sB_ssi * 0.3,  # 30% of SSI
    `1500` = 1500 * 0.3 # 30% of $1,500
  ) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    3:4,
    names_to = "income_source",
    values_to = "aff_rent"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    subsidy = aff_rent_60ami - aff_rent # Calculate subsidy
  ) |> 
  select(3, 1, 5)

```

```{r}

sB_subsidy |>
  arrange(desc(income_source)) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "llc", linesep = "") |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position")

```

\newpage

Tabulate unique shares for both income source and household size:

```{r}
#| echo: true

sB_dist <- expand.grid(
  income_source = names(sB_income),
  hh_size = names(sB_person)
  ) |>
  mutate(pct = sB_income[income_source] * sB_person[hh_size])

```

```{r}

sB_dist |>
  arrange(income_source) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "llc", linesep = "") |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position")

```

\
Multiply each household share by the total number of households served (150) to determine the respective number served for each group (`hh_served`), rounded to the nearest whole number:

```{r}
#| echo: true

sB_served <- sB_dist |> 
  mutate(hh_served = round(pct * sB_hh_served)) 

```

\newpage

### Model results

Join the monthly subsidy amounts(`subsidy`) by income source and household size and calculate annual subsidy per household (`subsidy_annual`). Multiply that figure by the number of households served to calculate the rental assistance required (`budget_rent`), then re-total to account for overhead costs (`budget_total`):

```{r}
#| echo: true

sB_budget <- sB_served |> 
  left_join(sB_subsidy, join_by(income_source, hh_size)) |> 
  mutate(
    subsidy_annual = subsidy * 12,
    budget_rent = subsidy_annual * hh_served,
    budget_total = budget_rent/(1 - sB_overhead)

### Scenario B results

*Average annual program cost per household: $20,200.95*

\
Under Scenario B, a total of 150 households experiencing housing insecurity are served. Although two-thirds are individuals who have lower housing costs than households with children, the average cost per household is over twice that of Scenario A, due to the deep level of subsidy provided. The estimated annual cost for the rental assistance alone is \$2,424,114. Coupled with a higher administrative overhead for expanded case management (20%), the total projected funding required is \$3,030,142.50.

## Scenario C – Reduce Severe Cost Burden for Lower-Income Working Families

This scenario outlines a LRSP with a total annual allocation of $500,000. The primary goal of the program is to reduce housing cost burden among households with incomes between 30% and 50% AMI. Households must have one working adult and one or more dependent. The model uses the following inputs to estimate the number of households served.

Notes:

* SAFMR refers to the Small Area Fair Market Rent as adopted by Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority (ARHA) for 2023.
* The affordable monthly rent is 40% of gross household income, not the standard 30%.
* The subsidy calculated for each household is respective to their household size.
* The administrative overhead includes housing-specific case management.

\newpage

### Inputs

Assign budget (dollars) and overhead costs (percent) variables:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Budget allocation
sC_budget <- 500000

# Overhead percentage
sC_overhead <- 0.15

```

Assign household distributions by AMI and unit size (number of bedrooms):

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of households by AMI
sC_ami <- c(`30% AMI` = 0.25, `40% AMI` = 0.50, `50% AMI` = 0.25)

# Distribution of households by unit size
sC_unit <- c(`bedroom1` = 1/3, `bedroom2` = 1/3, `bedroom3` = 1/3)

```

Under this scenario, only households with a dependent are eligible, so the model will exclude 1-person households. For simplicity, only households with 2 to 4 persons are considered. We will distribute household sizes by unit type accordingly:

* 1-bedroom: 100% 2-person
* 2-bedroom: 50% 2-person, 50% 3-person
* 3-bedroom: 50% 3-person, 50% 4-person

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Distribution of household sizes by unit size
sC_person <- list(
    `bedroom1` = c(`person2` = 1),
    `bedroom2` = c(`person2` = 0.5, `person3` = 0.5),
    `bedroom3` = c(`person3` = 0.5, `person4` = 0.5)
  )

```

```{r}

\newpage

Create data frame with all permutations for income, unit size, and household sizes. Exclude non-valid combinations of unit and household size:

```{r}

  AMI = names(sC_ami),
  bedrooms = names(sC_unit),
  hh_size = unlist(lapply(names(sC_person), function(unit) names(sC_person[[unit]])))
  ) |>
  distinct() |> 
  filter(
    !(bedrooms == "bedroom1" & !hh_size == "person2"),
    !(bedrooms == "bedroom2" & hh_size == "person4"),
    !(bedrooms == "bedroom3" & hh_size == "person2")
  )

```

\newpage

### Calculations

Create a function that tabulates the respective household distributions by AMI, household size, and unit type: 

```{r}

  for (bedroom in names(sC_person)) {
    current_dist <- subset(dist, bedrooms == bedroom)

    for (person_count in names(sC_person[[bedroom]])) {
      current_dist$hh_size <- as.character(person_count)

      current_dist$pct <- current_dist$households *

Join `sC_hh_type` with average FMR by unit size (`fmrs_avg`) and affordable rents (`sC_aff_rents`), then find difference between values to calculate the monthly subsidy (`subsidy`):

  left_join(sC_aff_rents, join_by(AMI, hh_size)) |> 
  left_join(fmrs_avg) |>

```

```{r}

# eval: false

  mutate(

### Some affordable rents almost equal to FMRs
Note that the subsidy for two household types is negligible --- under \$50. (See red values.) These cases are the result of higher affordable rents among those earning 50% AMI or more, along with the higher 40% tenant contribution.
:::

\
For the purposes of this model, these household types with no or very little subsidy need will be excluded. We will evenly redistribute the shares for those types across all other permutations.

```{r}
#| echo: true

sC_redist <- sC_subsidy |> 
  left_join(sC_dist, join_by(AMI, bedrooms, hh_size)) |> 
  filter(subsidy > 50) |> 
  mutate(
    pct_redist = pct + (1 - sum(pct))/n()
    )

```

```{r}

# OK

sC_redist |> 
  arrange(AMI, bedrooms) |> 
  select(1:3, 6:8) |> 
  mutate(
    across(4:6, ~ round(.x, 4))
    ) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "lllccc", linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1:2, valign = "top") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 8)

Calculate annual subsidy per household (`subsidy_annual`), determine each share of the total annual program budget (minus overhead costs) by household size (`budget`), then divide by the annual subsidy per household to calculate the estimates number of households served per household size (`hh_served`):

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Annual subsidy per household size
sC_subsidy_annual <- sC_redist |>
  mutate(subsidy_annual = subsidy * 12) |> 
  mutate(
    budget = (sC_budget * (1 - sC_overhead)) * pct_redist,
    hh_served = budget / subsidy_annual
  )

```

```{r}

# OK

sC_subsidy_annual |>
  select(1:3, 9:11) |> 
  mutate(hh_served = formattable::digits(hh_served, 3)) |> 
  arrange(AMI) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "lllccc", linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1:2, valign = "top") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 8)

```


\newpage

Summarize the estimated budget and households served by AMI and household size:

```{r}
#| echo: true

sC_served <- sC_subsidy_annual |> 
  summarise(
    budget = sum(budget),
    hh_served = sum(hh_served),
    .by = c(AMI, hh_size)
  )

```

```{r}

# OK

sC_served |>
  mutate(hh_served = formattable::digits(hh_served, 3)) |> 
  arrange(AMI) |> 
  kbl(booktabs = T, align = "llcc", linesep = "", row.names = FALSE) |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1:2, valign = "top") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 8)

```

\newpage

### Model results

Round each estimate to the nearest whole number and determine total:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Rounded estimates with grand total
sC_estimate <- sC_served |>
  arrange(AMI, hh_size) |> 
  mutate(
    hh_served = round(hh_served),
    hh_size = case_match(
      hh_size,
      "person2" ~ "2 person",
      "person3" ~ "3 person",
      "person4" ~ "4 person"
    )
  ) |> 
  adorn_totals()

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-sC
#| tbl-cap: "Scenario C - Estimated Households Served by Household Size"
#| tbl-pos: H

# OK

sC_estimate |> 
  mutate(
    budget = formattable::currency(budget, digits = 0)
  ) |> 
  kbl(
    booktabs = T, align = "llcc", linesep = "", row.names = FALSE,
    col.names = c("Income", "Household size", "Budget", "Households served")
    ) |> 
  collapse_rows(1:2, valign = "top") |> 
  row_spec(0, bold = T) |> 
  row_spec(10, bold = T) |>
  kable_styling(full_width = T, latex_options = "hold_position")

```

::: callout-note
### Scenario C results

*Average annual program cost per household: \$7,327.57*

\
Under Scenario C, a total program budget of \$500,000 with a 15% administrative overhead leaves \$425,000 to fund rental assistance. Given the assumed household distributions by AMI, unit size, and household size, the total number of households served is 58. Over half of these would be 2- and 3-person households at 40% AMI.
